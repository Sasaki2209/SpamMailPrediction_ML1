Main Functions of the Code
1.Data Loading and Preparation:

The script reads data from a CSV file named academic_and_random_mails.csv.
It ensures the data is formatted correctly by stripping any trailing commas and converting categories into numerical labels ('spam' as 0 and 'ham' as 1).

2.TF-IDF Vectorization:

The script uses TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
This transformation is crucial for text classification as it transforms raw text into a form that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

3.Model Training and Comparison:

Logistic Regression without Regularization:
 A model with a very high C value (set to 1e12), which effectively means no regularization is applied.
Logistic Regression with Regularization:
 A model with a typical C value (set to 1.0), meaning regularization is applied.
Both models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

4.Model Evaluation:

The script prints the accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for both models.
These metrics provide a detailed look at how well the models perform, including precision, recall, and the balance between false positives and false negatives.

5.Visualization:

Confusion Matrices:
 Visualizes the classification performance for both models, highlighting the differences in true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Distribution of Ham and Spam Emails:
 Displays a count plot showing the distribution of the two categories in the dataset.
Learning Curves:
 Plots learning curves for both models to show how training and validation performance evolves with increasing training data size.
