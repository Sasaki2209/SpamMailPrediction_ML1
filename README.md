•	The email spam detection dataset used in this study consists of approximately 5,572 email messages, with each message represented by the 'Message' attribute and labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham' in the 'Category' attribute.
•	The Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes models, when trained on the preprocessed and vectorized email data, achieved high accuracy scores on the training data, demonstrating their effectiveness in the email spam detection task.
•	The data visualization techniques, such as the histogram and learning curve, provide valuable insights into the dataset and the model's performance, respectively.
